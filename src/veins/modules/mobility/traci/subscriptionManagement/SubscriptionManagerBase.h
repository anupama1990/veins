 * @class SubscriptionManagerBase
 *
 * This is an abstract class providing common for subscription managers. Each subscription
 * manager must have an update() method to inform it about subscription updates. To create
 * new subscriptions this class will provide a command interface and the connection to the
 * TraCI server. It will also provide an interface to store which ids have aready been
 * subscribed.
 *
 * A subscription manager is called via the update() method to update its internal state. For
 * example which vehicles are appeared/disappeared in/from the simulation. These state
 * changes can then be requested via the managers api (these are methods which are defined
 * additionally in the child classes and vary depending on what the subscription manager is
 * supposed to do).
